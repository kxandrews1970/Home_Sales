# Home_Sales
Module22 Challenge
For this challenge I used colab instead of straight VSC. I will admit, I do love VSC and still would use it daily.  But colab has it's advantages especially with bigger data.  Not a fan of jupyter notebook either but I digress.  This one uses spark3.5.0 to play with home_sales dataframe. Cache and uncache and use parquet
